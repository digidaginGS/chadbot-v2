WANKO MANKO

what is wanko manko ?

Wanko Manko is a rune which is based on a concept of a very interesting manga/anime idea Casey Rodamor posted on his blog long before Ordinals. The team of Inscribed Pepes found the story and etched a no pre-mine fair mint rune based on it, called WANKO•MANKO•RUNES (https://magiceden.io/runes/WANKO%E2%80%A2MANKO%E2%80%A2RUNES) & received the stamp of approval from Casey on twitter. It has since turned into the ultimate left-curve decentralized community effort to meme Casey's brilliant yet twisted mind. You can read the story here: https://wankomanko.com/
